  - heading: How does this thing work?
    text: The only thng you need to star is to create a new scene and add the game
      manager prefab. It handles all the instances of the other managers for you to
      comunicate with. Each manager handles there own job, to acces to there functions
      or data you most talk to the properties created in the game manager. Take a
      look and explore the code, hope it helps you jump start somethings.

  - heading: What are the debug and qa flags for?
    text: When debug is on it allows all the debug logs made with the DebuggerUtil
      to appear on the console. QA is used to turn on any JUnity  GUI used for testing,
      so far only the player manager has this.
